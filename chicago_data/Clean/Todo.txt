Turn Location column in libraries.csv into two columns: latitude, longitude.
Turn Block column in sex_offenders.csv into two approximate(?) columns as above

Remove unneeded columns from: business_licenses.csv, sex_offenders.csv, libraries.csv,

Figure out how to use the haversine function in sql_stuff.py through python interface with sqlite objects. (i.e. talk to matt wachs again)
